  <h2><strong>Article IV: Common Objections</strong></h2>
</div>

1. **Types of Objections**

   **Foundation Objections:**
   - **Lack of foundation**: When testimony is given without first establishing the witness's basis of knowledge
     * Example: Witness testifying about a document's contents without establishing they've seen or read it
   
   - **Improper foundation**: When the background information provided doesn't adequately support the evidence
     * Example: Attempting to submit a letter without proving who wrote it

   - **Lack of authentication**: When evidence hasn't been properly identified or verified
     * Example: Presenting a contract without verifying signatures

   - **No personal knowledge**: When a witness testifies about matters they didn't personally observe
     * Example: "I heard from someone that the defendant was there"

   **Question Format Objections:**
   - **Leading the witness**: Questions that suggest the desired answer
     * Example: "You saw the defendant run away, didn't you?"

   - **Compound question**: Asking multiple questions at once
     * Example: "Did you see the defendant enter the bank and pull out his gun?"

   - **Argumentative**: Challenging or arguing with the witness rather than asking questions
     * Example: "How can you expect us to believe that story?"

   - **Asked and answered**: When a question has already been asked and responded to
     * Example: Repeatedly asking the same question hoping for a different answer

   - **Badgering the witness**: Aggressive, intimidating, or harassing questioning
     * Example: Repeatedly demanding answers after witness has responded

   - **Assumes facts not in evidence**: Question includes unproven facts
     * Example: "When did you stop stealing cattle?" when theft hasn't been established

   **Evidence Objections:**
   - **Relevance**: Evidence or testimony has no bearing on the case
     * Example: Questions about unrelated past events

   - **Hearsay**: Repeating statements made by someone not present in court
     * Example: "My friend told me he saw the defendant there"

   - **Speculation**: Witness guessing or making assumptions
     * Example: "I think he probably intended to rob the store"

   - **Best evidence rule**: Using copies when originals exist and are available
     * Example: Testimony about a document's contents when the document itself is available

   - **Prejudicial value outweighs probative value**: Evidence's potential to prejudice outweighs its usefulness
     * Example: Graphic descriptions that aren't necessary to prove the case

   - **Privileged information**: Protected communications or information
     * Example: Private conversations between husband and wife

   **Procedural Objections:**
   - **Beyond the scope**: Questions outside the topics covered in direct examination
     * Example: Asking about new topics during cross-examination

   - **Improper character evidence**: Bringing up past conduct to prove current behavior
     * Example: "The defendant was arrested five years ago"

   - **Improper impeachment**: Attacking witness credibility without proper foundation
     * Example: Suggesting witness is lying without evidence

   - **Narrative response**: Witness giving long, story-like answers instead of responding to specific questions
     * Example: Witness providing extensive unnecessary details

   - **Non-responsive answer**: Witness's answer doesn't address the question asked
     * Example: Q: "Where were you?" A: "Well, let me tell you about my whole day..."

2. **Making Objections**
   - Stand when objecting
   - State objection clearly and concisely
   - Provide brief basis if needed
   - Example: "Objection, Your Honor. Hearsay."

3. **Responding to Objections**
   - Listen to complete objection
   - Wait for judge's ruling
   - If sustained:
     * Rephrase question
     * Move to different line of questioning
   - If overruled:
     * Continue with original question
     * Note objection is preserved for record

4. **Common Objection Definitions**
   - **Sustained**: Judge agrees with the objection; question must be rephrased or withdrawn
   - **Overruled**: Judge disagrees with objection; questioning may continue as is
   - **Sidebar**: Private conference with judge to discuss objection without jury or witness hearing

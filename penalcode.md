# **Monroe Penal Code - Notes**

- **HUT** = Hold Until Trial, this means that a Judge shall sentence or give them a trial depending on the individual's entered plea.
- If a trial is required, open an LFM ticket.
- When Judges are in town, a person may plea to all charges listed, and the Judge will handle all sentencing or fine assignment related to any case.
- Judges may deviate from sentences listed here but MUST respect the drive for story and must never CK or sentence to life without explicit Admin approval or consent from the opposing players.
- Lawmen should feel comfortable charging criminals with the listed times and fines, but they are encouraged to lower them if the circumstances call for it. Use your judgment to foster good storytelling for both sides to enjoy the encounters.
- If caught blatantly committing a crime, not guilty verdicts will not be entertained.
- Starting at 401 Days, sentences can transition to Years (OOC Days). 401 Days = 1 Year, 501 Days = 2 Years, 601 Days = 3 Years... (1 OOC Day = 1440 Minutes) However, if a time is already in years, don't apply this to it (i.e. 1 Year = 1440 Days â‰  10 Years).
- Persons may plea Not Guilty to 1st Degree Felonies or Higher as well as any individual charges with a stated time of 1 Year or Higher. Anything else shall be appealed after the fact or handled by a Judge on scene.

**MAX OVERALL TIME** - 7 Years (7 OOC Days)  
**MAX OVERALL FINE** - $300
